## üåü Hi there! I'm Jothiprakash K

I'm from Trichy, Tamilnadu, India and my journey into data science began during my undergrad with a course in **Applied Multivariate Statistical Analysis**. That subject sparked my interest, leading me to pursue a **Master's in Data Science at IIT Guwahati**.

At IIT, I built a strong foundation in **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, and Computer Vision**. Upon graduating, I joined the R&D Software division at TVS Motors as a **Software Engineer**.

In this role, I've been developing **next-generation Human-Machine Interface (HMI)** solutions. It's been a fantastic experience applying my AI and machine learning background to build software that directly enhances user experience and safety. I'm driven by solving these kinds of challenging problems and am always curious to learn what's next.
